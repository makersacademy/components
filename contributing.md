# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Have you:

- Checked that the styles match elsewhere (we haven't a style guide just yet);
- Checked that your naming conventions match those used elsewhere;
- Read the [developer guide](developer-guide.md);
- Named your branch according to the following pattern: `<issue-number>-<issue-name>`;
- Received explicit permission from Odin, god of gods, to submit a PR? He can get tetchy, and
- Flounced several times during the process?

If so, submit a PR and let's get ready to QA it! QA time is max. a week, and we'll drop a bunch of comments in if we see stuff we need to query.

Thank you again for contributing!
