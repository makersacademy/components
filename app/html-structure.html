				<h3>Keir Osbourne</h3>
				<p>&ldquo;I went into this code academy with no back-end development experience whatsoever and just a little bit of front-end experience. After completing the course I found a full-stack Ruby on Rails development job almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Keir now works at <a href="#">Survival International</a></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Michelle Brideau</h3>
				<p>&ldquo;At Makers Academy, we learned to code by spending as much time as possible actually coding. We pair-programmed, worked on group projects and got a lot of practical experience about being a developer.&rdquo;</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Tim Boeckmann</h3>
				<p>&ldquo;I have wasted so many hours looking for people with the right technical skills. Makers Academy has given me two solutions to this problem. Firstly, I learnt how to code, so I can build a sample product capable of proving a viable idea. Secondly, finding skilled developers is easier now that I understand the development process.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Tim is the founder of <a href="#">Seederboard</a></p>
