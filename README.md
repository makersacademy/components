A living document of styles at Makers Academy, with example HTML and CSS for constructing new parts of the website. Explore from [the main page](http://makersacademy.github.io/style_guide).

### What's the rationale?

It's component-based. That means that any given interface (including e.g. print interfaces) can be constructed from components.

Components can have huge numbers of different layouts, thematic variations, and so on. Only some of these variations are available to be used inside other components, or within pages. These 'public interfaces' are called _modules_. There is a hierarchy to modules:

- **Quarks** are the most basic modules. They exist to perform a single function. For example, the [Call to Action](components/components/quarks/cta.html). Multiple Quarks can be combined to create Atoms.
- **Atoms** are intermediate modules. These are collections of quarks in abstract, but often useful, combinations. For example, the [Call to Action Block](components/components/quarks/cta-block.html). Multiple atoms can be combined to create molecules.
- **Molecules** are high-level modules. These are collections of atoms in a template format, and are designed to be placed straight in to pages. They are generally full-pagewidth, and are designed to maintain a vertical (downwards) flow. You should use Molecules to build new pages. There are few molecules by design: this keeps styling consistent and on-brand.

#### Some rules
- Molecules can have fixed heights, all other patterns cannot.
- Layout (such as height and alignment) is set by the 'parent' module. For example, the CTA quark is laid out by the CTA block atom. The CTA block atom's layout is determined by parent molecules, such as the Three-up block.

### What's the HTML like?

Semantic HTML is used where appropriate. For example, `<section>` is used to delineate content within a container. `<div>` is used too, when content is more general-purpose. The real focus has been on creating a descriptive **class structure**.

HTML classes are structured using a [Block-Element-Modifier (BEM)](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) syntax. For example, the Title Block module looks like this:

```html
<div class="title-block title-block--left">
  <h1 class="title title-block__title">
    Title
  </h1>
  <p class="body title-block__body">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. A, vero, repudiandae.
  </p>
</div>
```

Thus, a `.title-block` class can have modifiers - in this case, aligning its contents to the left with the `--left` class modifier - and elements within it can be specifically styled - in this case, the `.title` [Title quark](components/quarks/title.html) can be addressed with the `.title-block__title` class, and the `.body` [Body quark](components/quarks/body.html) can be addressed with the `.title-block__body` class. This class naming helps to avoid issues of Specificity when certain combinations are especially common, by avoiding the use of CSS inheritance selectors.

> CSS inheritance selectors are not to be totally avoided - for example, molecules can sometimes set specific `display` properties for their child quarks. In general, though, this should be refactored out to avoid selector chains.

This style of doing the HTML is extremely amenable to a conventional template structure for views server-side. One could easily imagine doing something like this to quickly spin up a flexible CTA block:

```erb
<%= render partial: "components/quarks/cta-block", locals: { 
  { :text => "Apply now", :link => apply_path }, 
  { :text => "See more", :link => clients_path } 
}, as: :ctas } %>
```

And in the cta-block.erb file:

```erb
<% ctas.each do | cta | %>
    <%= render partial: "components/quarks/cta", locals: { 
      :text => cta.fetch(:text, "Untitled"), 
      :link => cta.fetch(:link, "#") 
    } %>
<% end %>
```

### What's the CSS like?

Since we're using BEM syntax, the CSS is quite legible. It is also highly amenable to component-izing. In this example repository, a CSS structure is suggested: Sass files are arranged in the same way as HTML partials.

Each class in the SCSS source files separates the concerns of:

1. _structure_, which is the internal properties of that component alone,
2. _theming_, which is the presentational aspect of a components, and
3. _child layout_, which is the arrangement of child components within the class.

Components are designed to stand alone, so _structure_ and _child layout_ are rarely abstracted. However, _theming_ is highly abstracted. Almost all theming can occur via mixins, which are `include`d inside CSS classes. Almost all mixins should take as their argument a Sass variable. This way, the entire site can be 're-skinned' from the suggested _variables.scss file (layout is broadly unaffected). For example, the animation mixin (declared in [_mixins.scss](components/sass/_mixins.scss):

```scss
@mixin transition($transition) {
  -webkit-transition: $transition;
  transition: $transition;
}
```

is only included in classes with one of three `$transition` variables, declared in [_variables.scss](components/sass/_variables.scss):

```scss
$transition-standard: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
$transition-faster: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
$transition-slower: all 0.4s ease-in-out;
```

> There is an argument to further separate concerns further, by introducing `--full`, `--small`, `--backgrounded`, `--background-imaged` as classes. This would make setting common structural heights easier in the short-term. Thoughts are appreciated!

### What's the UX like?

Much focus has been given to the **funnel** aspect of the site UX. That is, maximising the number of visitors who proceed from visit (funnel stage 1) to application (funnel stage 2) and to acceptance (funnel stage 3). To that end, visitors have one 'path' they can take, in two different (and complementary) ways:

1. 'Horizontally', i.e. 'across' pages of content, and
2. 'Vertically', i.e. 'down' a single page of content.

The three main tactics we have used to achieve this are:

1. Affordance for vertical movement: more content is always available to read by scrolling down, encouraging the engaged user to do so (with minimal interaction required),
2. A clear Call to Action structure: one to move 'horizontally', and one at the end of a 'vertical' path (which grants access to funnel stage 2), and
3. Minimal content unless the current page is explicitly to deal with that content (elsewise, a brief pr√©cis of content and a horizontal call to action _to that page_ is provided).

### What's the Design like?

To achieve the main UX aims, Design:

1. Makes use of the Golden Section (1:1.618) for affordance (blocks are always less than 100% screen height on desktops), and occasionally for aesthetic,
2. Makes use of two, and only two, call to action styles for clear site-wide navigation and vertical movement encouragement, and
3. Makes use of typographic styles and vertical rhythm to keep the aesthetic clean and minimal (:construction:).
